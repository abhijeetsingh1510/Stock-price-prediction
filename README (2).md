# **Stock Market Price Prediction**

The stock market is a complex and ever-changing ecosystem where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. Numerous factors influence stock prices, including company performance, economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Understanding these intricate relationships is key to making informed investment decisions.

## **Problem Statement**

Predicting stock prices requires a comprehensive analysis of various data points, such as historical stock prices, financial statements, market trends, and external factors impacting the business. Participants will be provided with historical stock market data, including price trends, trading volumes, and relevant financial indicators. The dataset covers a diverse range of stocks from the NSE, spanning different sectors and markets.

Your task is to analyze this data, identify meaningful patterns, and create a predictive model that can anticipate future closing prices.

### **Data Provided**

The dataset includes:
- Historical stock prices
- Trading volumes
- Relevant financial indicators

### **Objectives**

1. **Analyze Historical Data**: Study the historical data to understand price trends, trading volumes, and financial indicators.
2. **Identify Patterns**: Identify meaningful patterns that could indicate future price movements.
3. **Build Predictive Models**: Develop and evaluate predictive models to forecast future closing prices of stocks.

### **Tools and Technologies**

Participants are encouraged to use various tools and technologies to achieve the objectives, including:
- Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine learning frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
- Statistical methods and algorithms for time series analysis

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Models will be evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting the closing prices. Key metrics for evaluation may include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the project:
1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://kaggle.com/competitions/mosaic24-ps1).
2. Explore the data and perform initial data preprocessing.
3. Develop and validate your predictive models.
4. Submit your predictions as per the competition guidelines.
